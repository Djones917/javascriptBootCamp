// 1. You can not define a variable more than once! or use two "let" to reasign a value.
let petName = "Sammy";
//let petName = "Silver";
// But you can change that value if you do
petName = "Silver";
console.log(petName);

// 2. There are rules to variable names.
// variables can start with a-z upper or lowercase or and two charaters $ and _  numbers just can't be the first character. 
let test_ = 2;
let result = 3 + 4;


// 3. Variables names can not be reserved keywords
// let let = 12; example
